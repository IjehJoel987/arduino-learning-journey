Arduino Learning Journey ðŸš€

This repository documents my progress while learning Arduino and embedded systems.  
From blinking LEDs to building real-world mini-projects, Iâ€™m practicing hardware + software integration step by step.  

---

 ðŸ“‚ Projects so far
- Blinking LED (Hello World of Arduino)
- Shift Register LED Pattern (bit shifting practice)
- LCD Counter
- Calculator (Serial Monitor + Keypad input)
- Joystick Servo Controller
- DC/Stepper Motor Control
- Buzzer and Tone Experiments

---

 ðŸ§  What Iâ€™m learning
- Digital & analog I/O  
- Bitwise operations & shift registers  
- Interfacing LCDs, motors, sensors  
- Keypad inputs for user interaction  
- Serial communication basics  

---

ðŸŽ¯ Next Goals
- Security system using Keypad + LCD + Servo  
- Explore ESP32 & IoT projects  
- Learn communication protocols (I2C, SPI, UART)  
- Connect sensors like RFID, RTC, temperature  

---

ðŸ”§ Tools
- Arduino Uno  
- C++ (Arduino IDE)  
- Components: LEDs, motors, sensors, displays, keypads
